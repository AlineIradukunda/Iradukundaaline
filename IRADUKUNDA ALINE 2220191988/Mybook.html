			  Introduction 
			  
 Java programming refers to the process of writing code in the Java programming language, which is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). Java is widely used for developing various types of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, desktop software, and enterprise systems. It is known for its platform independence, robustness, security features, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making Java a popular choice for building cross-platform applications.
 
	Tools used to develop this system in java programming

Eclipse IDE: an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. 

MySQL Connectors: MySQL provides standards-based drivers for JDBC, ODBC, and Net enabling developers to build database applications in their language.
